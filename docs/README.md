# Storybook docs (generated)

This folder is intended to contain a Storybook static build suitable for publishing on GitHub Pages (repository -> Settings -> Pages -> Source: main /docs folder).

How to generate locally:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\vkpal\OneDrive\Desktop\My-calander-project\my-calendar-app"
npm run build-storybook:docs
# then commit and push `docs/` to `main` to publish via GitHub Pages
git add docs
git commit -m "chore: add generated Storybook to docs for GitHub Pages"
git push origin main
```

Notes:
- This repository already includes a GitHub Action that can publish Storybook to `gh-pages` automatically. Using `/docs` is an alternative that lets GitHub Pages serve directly from the `main` branch.
- If you prefer CI to publish, don't commit `docs/`; instead keep it generated by CI and published to `gh-pages` (current workflow).
